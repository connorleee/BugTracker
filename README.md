## Usage
Log into BugTracker after creating an account and begin by adding a new project from the dashboard.

## Technologies Used
- React 
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- ORM (Prisma)

## Development Notes
### Prerequisites
**Node**

Before you can install Node, you’ll need to install two other applications. Fortunately, once you have these on your machine, installing Node takes just a few minutes.[1]
 
**Mac OS**
> - **XCode** Apple’s XCode development software is used to build Mac and iOS apps, but it also includes the tools you need to compile software for use on your Mac. XCode is free and you can find it in the Apple App Store.
> 
> - Via Terminal `xcode-select --install`
> 
> - **Homebrew** Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac — it makes installing most open source sofware (like Node) as simple as writing `brew install node`.
> - To install Homebrew just open Terminal and type `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`. You’ll see messages in the Terminal explaining what you need to do to complete the installation process. Now type `brew install node`.

**Windows Installation Steps**[2]
> - Download the Windows installer from the [Nodes.js®](http://nodejs.org/) web site.
> - Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
> - Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
> - Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.

**PostgresSQL**
**Mac OS**
> - run `brew update`
> - run `brew install postgresql`
> - run `brew services start postgresql`
> - run `psql postgres` (if this fails close and reopen your terminal)
> - run `CREATE ROLE pgrootuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';`
> - run `ALTER ROLE pgrootuser CREATEDB;`

### Project setup
<!-- ### Install posgress -->
> - run `npm install` in your project directory
> - run `npx prisma migration dev --name init`
> - run `npx prisma generate`
